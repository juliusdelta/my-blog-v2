## Intro
Hard-working programmer with a passion for developing products that provide the best experience for users and also for building
effecient product development processes. As a senior software engineer I've been able to successfully lead engineering teams in
developing features that have had a positive impact on conversion metrics and important client relationships. I'm looking to continue to
expand my skillset and product development knowledge in order to continually deliver high quality work. My experience ranges from heavy
frontend development with the latest javascript technologies to backend development ensuring database queries are optimized for performance.
