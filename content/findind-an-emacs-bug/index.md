I was recently working on a porcelain for local database management in Emacs, `tablemacs` (name tbd). The general idea here is to give a magit style interface for interacting with a local database. This mode is built off `SQLi` (sql-interactive-mode) and uses a hidden `comint` buffer to execute commands. Everything was working great till I encountered a really weird issue. Let me preface everything with, I'm still **very** new to elisp and am still very much a beginner. Not only is it a radically different language than what I'm used to, the paradigms are also just very unique to emacs. If some of the code here looks wrong, it's a mistake in translation as some of it was modified for ease of understanding.

## The process & the Issue
Right now `tablemacs` creates a hidden `comint` buffer with `sql-interactive-mode` engaged. I then use `comint-redirect-send-command-to-process` which redirects the output of a comint command to an aribtrary buffer, which is my `tablemacs-status` buffer.
> (comint-redirect-send-command-to-process COMMAND OUTPUT-BUFFER PROCESS ECHO &optional NO-DISPLAY)
>
> Documentation
>
> Send COMMAND to PROCESS, with output to OUTPUT-BUFFER.
> With prefix arg, echo output in process buffer.
>If NO-DISPLAY is non-nil, do not show the output buffer.

This works as you'd expect however, there's some artifacts in the output. Here's what I get for my `show-tables` command which just runs `show tables;`:

```shell
show tables;^ M 
+--------------------------+^ M
| Tables_in_tablemacs_test |
+--------------------------+^ M
| test_table               |^ M
+--------------------------+^ M
```

All those `^M`s means it's displaying the carriage returns in the redirected buffer. Obviously, I wanted to remove those.

I searched around for something that could help and I had already known about comint filters. These allow you to run filter functions on the strings as they or after they've interacted with the comint buffer. Here's a non-comprehensive list of a few of the available "filters" list variables you can add filter functions too:
- comint-input-filter-functions
- comint-output-filter-functions
- comint-preoutput-filter-functions
- comint-redirect-filter-functions
- comint-redirect-original-filter-function

There's a few more but those are the ones that were interesting to me in this situation. [Looking at the documentation](http://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Var/comint-redirect-filter-functions.html), `comint-redirect-filter-functions` seemed perfect. 

>List of functions to call before inserting redirected process output.
Each function gets one argument, a string containing the text received
from the subprocess. It should return the string to insert, perhaps
the same string that was received, or perhaps a modified or transformed
string.
>
>The functions on the list are called sequentially, and each one is given
the string returned by the previous one. The string returned by the
last function is the text that is actually inserted in the redirection buffer.
>
>You can use `add-hook' to add functions to this list
either globally or locally. 

Per the documentation, filter functions accept a string argument and return a string which is then passed to the next filter function. They are run in the order they are placed in the `comint-redirect-filter-functions`. Easy enough. I then looked around and found `comint-strip-ctrl-m`! This seemed just perfect. The [documentation for it](https://doc.endlessparentheses.com/Fun/comint-strip-ctrl-m.html) seemed a little strange to me though:

>comint-strip-ctrl-m is an interactive compiled Lisp function in `comint.el'.
>
>(comint-strip-ctrl-m &optional STRING)
>
>Strip trailing `^M' characters from the current output group.
This function could be on `comint-output-filter-functions' or bound to a key. 

Seems ok so far! So I plugged it in with:

```lisp
(add-hook 'tablemacs-minor-mode-hook (lambda () (push 'comint-strip-ctrl-m comint-redirect-filter-functions) ))
```

**It did not work.**

## Investigation

I then moved to setting the `comint-redirect-filter-functions` globally and still it did not work. I thought surely I was doing something wrong, but when I used `describe-variable` on `comint-redirect-filter-functions` it appeared to have `comint-strip-ctrl-m` as it should. I'm still a beginner when it comes to elisp so I thought I was doing something wrong. So I wrote my own filter just to see:

```lisp
(defun tablemacs--comint-strip-ctrl-m-test (str)
  "test filter"
  (message "ran filter!")
  str)
```

Low and behold I got the message in my minibuffer. So what gives?

Well the next thing to do was to look at `describe-function` for `comint-strip-ctrl-m` which is as follows:

```lisp
(defun comint-strip-ctrl-m (&optional _string interactive)
  "Strip trailing `^M' characters from the current output group.
This function could be on `comint-output-filter-functions' or bound to a key."
  (interactive (list nil t))
  (let ((process (get-buffer-process (current-buffer))))
    (if (not process)
        ;; This function may be used in
        ;; `comint-output-filter-functions', and in that case, if
        ;; there's no process, then we should do nothing.  If
        ;; interactive, report an error.
        (when interactive
          (error "No process in the current buffer"))
      (let ((pmark (process-mark process)))
        (save-excursion
          (condition-case nil
	      (goto-char
	       (if interactive
	           comint-last-input-end comint-last-output-start))
	    (error nil))
          (while (re-search-forward "\r+$" pmark t)
	    (replace-match "" t t)))))))
```

Herein lies the culprit. This filter takes in an `&optional _string` and usually, variables prefixed with `_` means they aren't used. So if it's not using the passed in string, what's it doing? Well it's using `(get-buffer-process (current-buffer))` and then marking where the process command output starts and then searching through with `(research-forward "\r+$" pmark t)` which is what actually replaces the carriage returns. The big red flag here is that it's using the `(current-buffer)` which, in my use case, isn't the buffer that the process is running in, instead its my porcelein buffer. 

So the issue turned out to be the implementation of `comint-strip-ctrl-m` and not the way I was using it. 

## What to do next?

It's pretty clear to me that the function of `comint-strip-ctrl-m` doesn't match the documentation. Emacs documentation is _exceptional_ compared to anything else I've used, I mean it's known as the "self documenting text editor" for a reason. However, this is a very specific case where the documentation, or expected implicit behavior derrived from the documentation, doesn't line up with reality. So what should I do?

### My fix
In my code, I just wrote my own filter to do exactly `comint-strip-ctrl-m` should do. It looks like this:

```lisp
(defun tablemacs--comint-strip-ctrl-m (str)
  "Filter function to remove carriage returns from comint output
   This is needed because one provided by comint rely's on `current-buffer`
   to get the process and it's always going to be wrong."
  (replace-regexp-in-string "\r" "" str))
```

So this now works with `comint-redirect-filter-functions` as expected.

```shell
show tables; 
+--------------------------+
| Tables_in_tablemacs_test |
+--------------------------+
| test_table               |
+--------------------------+
```

### Emacs bug report?

At this point I'm considering filing a report, or at least a request to update the documentation for this rather specific small bug. It's not like this is a huge breaking bug for most users, and it's a pretty specific use case. But this might open up a potential contribution opporunity or at least a way to get involved with the emacs maintainer community at least a little bit. Possible fixes could consist of one of the following:
1. Updating the documentation for `comint-strip-ctrl-m` to explictely state it uses `current-buffer` instead of just the passed in string.
2. Updating `comint-strip-ctrl-m` to actually use the string it's passed and perform the same string editing functions.
3. Creating a new `comint-strip-ctrl-m-filter` (name TBD?) which takes in a string, modifies it and returns a modified string.

I don't know. Maybe someone will let me know if this is in fact an issue or if I'm just missing something else important.

Happy Hacking.
