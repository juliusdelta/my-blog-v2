{{ offload(number = 1) }}

I'm happy to be taking part in the [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com) to offload challenge. Per the challenge:

> The whole point of #100DaysToOffload is to challenge people to publish 100 posts on their personal blog in a year. Posts don’t need to be long-form, deep, meaningful, or even that well written. If there are spelling and grammar mistakes, or even if there’s no real point to the post, so what? What’s important is that you’re writing about the things you want to write about.

I've always struggled writing consistently for my personal blog so I am using this as an opportunity to up my game. I'm sure there will be a wide range of topics I cover from development, to engineering organizational processes, to personal rambling about the state of some open source project. Each one will be tagged with [`#100DaysToOffload`](/tags/100daystooffload) so I can track all the progress throughout 2021. Febuary 10th should be the official start date, so Feburary 10th of 2022 I'll have completed this challenge.

I'd encourage you to ping me on Twitter or Mastodon (or IRL) if I'm not keeping up with it as this is a personal goal of mine.

Cheers.
