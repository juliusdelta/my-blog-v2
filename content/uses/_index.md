### Wishlist
There are several FOSS technologies I want to put to use in the near term.

- Goat Counter
This is an analytics tool that can be self-hosted. It also has privacy as a priority so no cookies or really any tracking of user agents or PID. Just used for analytics
- LinkDing
This is just a simple book marking site that's self hosted
- BitWarden
A replacement for 1Password & LastPass that again, can be completely self hosted. It also comes with extensions for all major browsers and platforms so the UX stays pretty similar to 1Password.
- Gemini
A different web protocol where javascript and ads basically don't exist. It's not exactly an http replacement but it's a protocol used for content only sharing. No JS :)
