### Software
For work I use a MacOS machine. For personal use I've been using Arch for about 3 months. I'm in the process of upgrading the NVME drive in my PC for a new fresh install of Arch for personal projects.

#### Daily Drivers
- Terminal: [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
- Shell: [ZSH w/ Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- Shell Theme: [PowerLevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- Editor: [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
- Editor Config Base: [Doom Pre-Configuration](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs)
- Tasks/Time/Notes/Journal: [Org Mode for Emacs](https://orgmode.org/)
- Theme: [Nord Theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/)
- Window Manager:
  - MacOS: [Yabai WM](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) w/ [Skhd](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd)
  - Arch Linux: [XMonad](https://xmonad.org/)

Emacs houses a lot of other functionality that I would use other apps for. It's my rss reader, gemini client, task manager, writing tool, rest client, repl for multiple languages, and perpetual time sink.

#### Other Random Tools

### Wishlist
There are several FOSS technologies I want to put to use in the near term.

- [Goat Counter](https://www.goatcounter.com/): This is an analytics tool that can be self-hosted. It also maintains privacy as a priority so no cookies or really any tracking of user agents or PID. Just used for analytics
- [LinkDing](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding): This is a web bookmark application that is self hosted.
- [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/): A replacement for 1Password & LastPass that again, can be completely self hosted. It also comes with extensions for all major browsers and platforms so the UX stays pretty similar to 1Password. It's also open source.
- [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/): A different web protocol where javascript and ads basically don't exist. It's not exactly an http replacement but it's a protocol used for content only sharing. No JS, Ads, Cookies, or tracking.
- [Next Cloud](https://nextcloud.com/) or [Own Cloud](https://owncloud.com/): A replacement for anything "cloud related". My hope is to set this up and run it on a Rasberry Pi from my home to backup all my photos & files and keep it secure myself.
